I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at CEREMADE, Université Paris Dauphine – PSL and at the University of Parma, under the co-supervision of Prof. Antonin Chambolle and Prof. Massimiliano Morini. 
I am also a fellow of the MathInParis2020 project, funded by the European Union.

My studies focus in Mathematical Analysis, in between Calculus of Variations and Geometric Measure Theory. The broad subject of my doctoral research is the [Mean Curvature Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_curvature_flow). In particular, I investigate questions related to weak solutions, asyptotic behaviour and discrete approximations for related geometric flows.

In the other pages you can find my CV, the link to my research papers and some more informations about me.
